            One of my favorite parts of my design journey definitely has to be
            my time with Design for America at school, especially because of all
            the friends I was able to be on board with in my last year. This org
            started out as a small org and gateway to my first experience with
            HCD, and it continued to grow as an org and into a group of friends
            and community that I still think about today! :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            I was especially excited about this project because mental health is
            very important to me, so being able to employ HCD to work toward a
            solution kept me invested. My team's solution to the problem space
            of mental wellness for college students was a mobile application,
            with collaboration from Triton Software Engineering and
            International Health Collective.

            The result of our collaboration was our application, tentatively
            named Sprout as of this entry, that allows students from UC San
            Diego to input their schedules to find events and activities related
            to mental wellness based on their availability. Users are
            incentivized by the growth of a plant avatar whose growth depends on
            the completion of activities or attendance on behalf of the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our solution is consistent with issues that were persistent with the
            lack of use of on-campus resources such as inconvenient sourcing
            (students struggle to find a space where they can view all events as
            once), difficult timing (students struggle to find events or
            activities that fit their schedule), as well as general lack of
            information (students know about CAPS on-campus but not much else).
            Sprout’s scheduling functionality will match all existing events
            with open spaces in the user’s schedule which addresses both
            inconvenient sourcing as well as difficulty of timing. An additional
            functionality within the application will simply act as an
            information page which provides students with additional knowledge
            on topics like CBT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in addition to
            off-campus resources that might be helpful to them. All of these
            features were validated through findings from research.

            Identifying and immersion of the problem

        <div class="identify-text-1">
          <p>
            At the beginning of the year we identified mental wellness as a
            relevant and scalable issue. Universities report increased mental
            health crises by students during the academic year and that the
            scale and depth of this issue was similar at other academic
            institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After identifying this issue, we wanted to spend the quarter in the
            immersion phase, which focused on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>research</li>
            <li>building emapthy</li>
            <li>organizing recurring themes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For this phase, we spent the rest of the quarter leveraging online
            research. As a team we looked at and discussed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>research articles</li>
            <li>reports from relevant NGOs</li>
            <li>
              social media pages relevant to mental wellness (e.g. Confessions
              pages)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="identify-text-2">
          <p>
            By looking at these resources, we were able to get a better
            understanding on what use cases were for mental health issues in
            academic environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this secondary research, we did activities as a group that
            focused on building more empathy via:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>personas</li>
            <li>journey maps</li>

        <div class="ideation-text-1">
          <p>
            During the winter quarter, our team's goals were to get through the
            ideation and design phase of our project, which could be broken
            into:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              competitive analysis of other mental wellness-related applications
            </li>
            <li>creating How-Can-We statements</li>
            <li>ideating functionalities</li>
            <li>proposing functionalities to TSE</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Examples of existing mental health applications we took inspiration
            from were cognitive behavioral therapy, meditation, and mood
            tracking apps such as WellTrack, Headspace, and Daylio repsectively.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ideation-text-2">
          <p>
            We then made HCW statements that asked: how can we gameify and
            instill good habits that increase mental health?
          </p>
          <p>
            After this ideation and during the prototyping phase, we split into
            two subteams that focused on the Plant avatar and Scheduling
            features, respectively. In the Scheduling team, I contributed ideas
            and we proposed synchronization of personal schedules with on-campus
            resources plus daily check-ins/journaling. The Plant team specified
            features involving gamification of habit tracking through the plant
            avatars and currency/rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
            My team and I each made paper prototypes with the focus of getting
            our own ideas conceptualized and consolidated them in later
            meetings, with the functionalities being proposed to Triton Software
            Engineering.

          <p>
            During the spring quarter, we wanted to do more intensive research
            and validate the assumptions we made about the problem space from
            early on in the immersion phase. To achieve this, we made goals to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              conduct user research with student interviews and surveys targeted
              at UC San Diego students
            </li>
            <li>
              conduct research with professionals in the field of helping
              college students and any peripheral mental health persons
            </li>
            <li>
              hold a participatory design workshop with students and
              professionals
            </li>
            <li>
              gather and organize data from these findings and look into
              redesigning our product
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="reframe-2">
          <p>
            Why and how did we decide on going back into research? We reflected
            upon the wording of our HCW statements at the time, and realized
            that by focusing on gameifying and instilling good habits, we
            narrowed the types of solutions we would seek out and iterate upon
            from the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found this personally illuminating when we realized that we needed
            to word our HCW statements to be more insight centric, rather than
            solution centric. By framing our statements within a structure of
            user-place-behavior and using that to inform our measures of
            success, we came up with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              How can we students feel more comfortable talking about mental
              health on-campus?
            </li>
            <li>
              How can we help students take more advantage of on campus
              resources?
            </li>
            <li>
              How can we help students be more aware of their mental health?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The previous subteams were dissolved for a new set of subteams
            focused on Students, Professionals, and Workshop planning
            respectively. The student subteam compiled a survey with questions
            suited for students and distributed it amongst fellow classmates as
            well as on major social media pages to collect answers from the
            student population of UC San Diego. The student subteam also created
            an interview guide and conducted 6 interviews in person with at
            least two members of the team present.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of the professional subteam, I helped create the interview
            guide and made a table of potential interviewees to keep track of
            correspondence. In total, I interviewed 6 people total, 2 from the
            Pyschology/Psi Chi club, 3 psychologists from the VA hospital, and 1
            CAPS counselor. The questions focused on trying to understand their
            day-to-day experience in working with students or mental health
            patients and learning of potential resources or opportunities.

            Through interviewing health professionals at the local VA hospital
            and UC San Diego's CAPS, some notable things I learned were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              about online resources that provide a framework for telemental
              health solutions, e.g.
              <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/apps/ptsdcoachonline/"
                >PTSD coach</a
              >
              and <a href="https://www.psychologytools.com/">CBT worksheets</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              other telemental health applications involving CBT and how they
              work and benefit users
            </li>
            <li>
              UC San Diego students feel a specific sense of isolation through
              their performance in STEM courses versus their peers
            </li>
            <li>
              UCSD students seldom use free mental wellness resources (e.g.
              group therapy sessions) that aren't as publicized as their CAPS
              drop-in sessions/call system

            Simultaneously, our team invited our stakeholders to validate our
            application features and give us insights on their journeys
            surrounding mental wellness. Around 10 stakeholders ended up showing
            up, including 2 IHC UCSD alumni, a member from TSE, our advisor from
            IHC as the mental health professional stakeholder, and UCSD students
            of various backgrounds.

            After the completion of the workshop, the team re-evaluated the data
            collected from the interviews and reviewed the data from the
            workshop. The data collected from the workshop validated previous
            designs that were created in the Winter Quarter. Based on this data,
            we decided to move forward with the designs and instead applied
            small modifications to better represent insights from the workshop.
          </p>
          <p>Some significant findings were that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              out of the resource centers available, students are commonly aware
              of resources on campus like CAPS, The Zone, SARC
            </li>
            <li>
              many students used Headspace if any mental health apps were used
            </li>
            <li>
              students are not aware of less publicized mental health resources
              that aren't CAPS sessions
            </li>
            <li>
              some like to avoid CAPS and try to handle stress on their own due
              to distrust of therapy efficacy
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            After getting attached to all the work, I'm still excited to see how
            the new team tackles the problem given our documentation during the
            19-20 school year!
