                <p>The first thing we wanted to do was to interview our client to get a better understanding of the types of members were
                involved in the organization. Since KOTX hasn't had its own website before, we also wanted to learn about its purpose
                and what was important to the org's board and its members. This would inform any features and architecture of the site,
                alongside the branding.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>they wanted dark background colors with bright accent colors</li>
                    <li>they believed users could be divided into prospective members, new members, current members, and persons looking to
                    collaborate with/book KOTX for entertainment</li>

                <p>We used the member types from the client interview to inform who we'd reach out to for our user interviews. In them, we
                asked them further questions about, from their point of view, what KOTX was to them, what a typical day with KOTX would
                be like, and any issues logistically that they felt could be improved within the org.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="interview-action">
                <p>Throughout our interviews, we learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>new and prospective members have very similar use cases and should thus be grouped together</li>
                    <li>Facebook events and groups were the main use cases in which members had issues (Specifically, sometimes posts would get occluded by other comments/posts and people would be left unaware of event
                    logistics.)</li>
                    <li>more understanding of the organization's fun-loving personality and branding</li>

            <div class="interview-text-2">

                <p>Our next steps involved finding inspiration for branding based on our client and users interviews. While taking into
                account our users' desire for a mixture of dark backdrop and bright accent colors, we looked at websites for college
                organizations, professional dance studios and dance groups.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comp-actions">
                <p>Discussions I had with my team involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We liked the pleasant and simple navigation of college orgs' websites, but didn't want to look like them entirely as we
                    felt college org's professional and sterile branding contrasted with KOTX's personality.</li>
                    <li>Finding out how to incorporate bright and dark colors. Sites for dance studios used black and dark colors to emulate a
                    dance studio or theater where lights are dimmed.</li>
                    <li>We liked how personalized bios with lighthearted graphics and copy made people and branding on websites feel
                    approachable.</li>

                <h3 class="sub-title">Styling challenges:</h3>
                <p>After finishing up most of the content in our wireframes, our stakeholders gave us varying
                opinions on styling:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>dark scheme with purple</li>
                    <li>bold scheme with streaks of color</li>
                    <li>gifs/graphics that show fun side of KOTX</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Taking these sentiments into account while trying to capture the true essence of KOTX was important to us since the
                group emphasized the personality the group had. When asked how they would describe themselves, a stakeholder said they
                were <span class="highlight">"lively, meme-y, inclusive and fun!"</span></p>
                <p>To address this, my team and I made our own individual style tiles (I made style tile 4!! hehe) based on our impressions of the group from interview
                data and iterated upon them after some collaborative discussion. The end results were 6 style tiles sent to members and
                our clients in a Google Form which we had them vote on which they felt represented the group's preferences best and give
                us feedback.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>differences between getting involved and actually joining the org wasn't exactly clear</li>
                    <li>gallery was hard to find due to it being under the Events page as "Archive"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our clients also gave us suggestions such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>more gallery visibility</li>
                    <li>more of an emphasis on contacting KOTX</li>
                    <li>new page suggestions: FAQ and dance policies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are the things we decided to do to address the feedback we got:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>changed the Archive to Gallery and increased visibility (font and album preview size)</li>
                    <li>made a contact page with people trying to formally reach out to KOTX; kept footer containing socials for more immediate
                    contact, with new/prospective members trying to figure out event details in mind</li>
                    <li>kept Staff under About page because of web page conventions, hoping access to contacts through contact page/footer to
                    offset any confusion</li>
                    <li>removed the videos under the Join page</li>

                <p>I remember it was during one of our weekly meetings and we happened to start discussing membership in KOTX. As we talked
                more about it, I realized each of my teammates' understanding of a member versus a non-member was slightly different,
                some saying non-members couldn't dance at all and another saying they couldn't go to socials.</p>
                <p>I pointed this difference in our respective mental models and we planned a (panic!!) interview with a board member who
                could speak on the specifics of membership.</p>
                <p>We learned that non-members could actually attend socials and dance at workshops, but they could not be in any videos,
                be a part of the Big/Little program, and were exempt from other discounts/benefits. We, thus, made graphics and added
                this content to the Join page.</p>
