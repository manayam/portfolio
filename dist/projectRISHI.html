            Project RISHI is a non-profit that aims to promote sustainable
            development in rural Indian communities. They use their site to
            connect with local community members and social enterprises to
            identify and find solutions for issues in target communities.

      <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The previous ENG 100D team left us a website that showcased different
        projects in Project RISHI, along with feedback from the previous
        partner. We were tasked with improving and implementing an online map
        tool that shows the impact of Project RISHI's initiatives.
      </p>

      <h2>Research and User Needs</h2>
      <p>
        We graphed our stakeholders in a matrix to assess their influence on our
        poject, conducted secondary research, and made personas based on that.
        Since our client was Project RISHI as a whole, we reached out to
        executives of the organization and the school chapters after and were
        able talk to Anish Kazane, president of the UC Berkeley chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our initial correspondence, he wanted a map system that displays and
        filters information on projects and for it to be updatable. He said he
        wanted this in order to make it accessible for members to update the
        site and to ultimately better inform philanthropists and other site
        visitors on how they can get involved with Project RISHI. He also wanted
        the site to be a platform for training future members but said that he
        did not expect this from us or for it to happen for a while.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img
            src="img/rishi/personaStaff.png"
            alt="personaStaff"
            style="width:100%"
          />
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img
            src="img/rishi/personaUser.png"
            alt="personaUser"
            style="width:100%"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        To guide us towards a solution, we reframed the insights and pain points
        above into opportunities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How might we make the site engaging so that it inspires
          philanthropists to contribute to or sponsor projects?
        </li>
        <li>
          How might we make the site updatable and accessible for current and
          future members?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interviews and Usability Tests</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted interviews and performed usability tests to determine
        users' engagement with the current Map feature and the site's overall
        pain points.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Map feature on the site had filler text and items were missing or
        were not explained in the legend. Meanwhile, other pages had
        inconsistent styling and had Lorem Ipsum text. After tests we asked
        users what they understood about the site and users were generally
        confused due to the incomplete look and content of the Project RISHI's
        site at the time. Thus, users' experience prevented them from being able
        to empathize or even engage with any of the projects that the
        organization was doing.
      </p>

      <h2>Difficulties and Learning</h2>
      <p>
        One difficulty we faced in the project is consistent contact with
        stakeholders. We were not able to connect with as many Project RISHI
        representatives as we would have liked, and the contact we did have with
        the one chapter was not as consistent. Thus, once we had data from the
        meetings we did have, we ran with that and made designs and changes and
        performed usability tests on what we could.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original prototype was hard coded using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        Because it was hard coded, it was difficult for any potential users to
        update, add, or remove information as needed, especially for the map
        feature. The coordinates themselves were entered using a file that Anish
        gave us. That made it difficult for members of Project RISHI to change
        the coordinates of each ward or potentially add new wards in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anish initially requested we develop using Ruby on Rails, so we switched
        to Drupal 7 since it made it easier for content to be updated through
        its prebuilt administrative framework. However, we felt as if Drupal 7
        gave us very limited options for the appearance of the website, in
        addition to being very tedious and inflexible. Since user experience was
        one of the most important aspects of this project, we decided to use and
        update the old design from the previous quarter and deploy it onto
        another framework called Meteor.
      </p>

      <h2>Design decisions + Final Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        We wanted to keep the homepage simple and moved the Map feature to a
        different page and placed only the mission statement on the homepage.
        The map subsection of the toolbar includes map filters to show the
        regions on the rural Indian communities with icons to label the
        project's topic. Also, the map before had terrain of mountains and
        ridges removed since we believed it was insignificant and made
        readability harder.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img/rishi/mapOld.png" alt="mapOld" style="width:100%" />
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img/rishi/mapNew.png" alt="mapNew" style="width:100%" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        We had content sent to us from other chapters for the About page. The
        Projects page listed individual projects and dropdown navigation on each
        topic in the map for consistency. We also included a Donate page for
        people wanting to contribute digitally. Because we decided to go with a
        coded page but wanted to address the need for teaching future members,
        we made some
        <span class="text-secondary"
          ><a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hWcOBDbWLGYf2ua8ZAwvNNJiDdXqptpDRBtI6pNtWDI/edit"
            >documentation</a
          ></span
        >.

            >live prototype</a
          ></span
        >
        to see our final design.
