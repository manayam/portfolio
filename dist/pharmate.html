            My team and I were tasked with building an interactive point-of-sale
            kiosk prototype. We leveraged online research to inform our ideas,
            storyboards, wireframes, and physical prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PharMate kiosk-locker setup is meant to coexist with, not fully
            replace, traditional in-person pickup. This is because, at least
            from our data and experience, people may prefer interacting with a
            real person instead of a machine; for others, the opposite is true.
            The idea is that with the divide between the traditional pharmacy
            line, the kiosk line, and the mobile app, wait times would be
            reduced overall.

      <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted online research and looked to other competitors that had
        POS kiosks in a medical or pharmacy context for inspiration and how we
        can better employ existing solutions in the current market.
      </p>

      <h2>Personas + Storyboards</h2>
      <p>
        We also looked at pharmacy and drug use cases to inform our personas. We
        made personas for a range of people that the kiosk could cater to, from
        people dealing with addiction to disabled persons. We decided to
        emphasize two personas: one that had needs for general efficiency of use
        and another that required an intuitive design and foreign language
        support.

      <h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
        We did some rapid prototyping and tests on a simple purchase flow, where
        users had to have the kiosk identify them and then have them pay for
        their prescription medicine. We had 1 note-taker and 1 facilitator while
        the rest of our group watched. We learned that prototype required more
        signifiers as to when a task was completed. Due to a lack of visual or
        auditory feedback, the user reached the payment stage and was confused
        that his ID was still in the card reader. In this case, we decided to
        have two card readers, one for identity and the other for payment.

      <h2>User Interviews</h2>
      <p>
        We interviewed people who have used any form of POS kiosk but tried to
        mostly interview people who used medical ones. We asked them questions
        on their general experience and pain points associated with the specific
        kiosk experience they used. Below are some of the more notable notes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Something the interviewees liked about the ATM was how in order to get
          the cash, you have pull out your credit/debit card before the door for
          cash opens. This ensures that the user wouldn’t forget his/her card.
        </li>
        <li>
          In one of the interviewee’s experiences with CVS pharmacy, she
          mentioned how you can opt to wait in the store or pick up the
          medication later with a confirmation text. However, when she chose to
          wait in the store, there was no signifier/feedback to let her know
          that her medication was ready.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another interviewee mentioned that she does not need to wait in heavy
          lines at the pharmacy when she is picking up her birth control
          prescription because her app tells her exactly when to pick it up.
          Although birth control is covered by her insurance she mentioned that
          she has the ability to pay on the app which she finds convenient. She
          also likes that she does not need to interact with the pharmacist or
          have to call for confirmation which speeds up the process of getting
          her prescriptions. Many interviewees also preferred the locker pick up
          as opposed to a vending machine pickup because the lockers would
          provide more security.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Crit</h2>
      <p>
        From the feedback in our crit, we decided to add a time delay between
        the moment you get the receipt and when you pick it up, much like the QR
        code portion of our prototype. This is because there needs to be some
        delay for someone to put medicine in the locker and for privacy demanded
        in today's kiosk technologies (e.g. Amazon Locker). We also rearranged
        the physical elements on our initial prototype to make it look less
        cluttered, a comment we received in usability tests.
      </p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Changes we made to our clickable prototypes based on usability testing
        involved: providing more audio or visual feedback to some screens to
        indicate the conclusion of a task or to prompt user to proceed, changing
        wording and prices to reflect real world ones, and creating an app
        version to separate the QR code process/preorder process from the
        in-person purchase process.

      <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
      <p>
        If we were to make further changes we would probably be investing more
        time and money into creating a high-fidelity prototype with better
        craft. Rather than using cardboard, perhaps we would consider using more
        durable material such as metal sheets or wood, anything that would
        resemble an actual kiosk. We would also consider installing LED lights
        for the lockers rather than using the Wizard of Oz method. Spray paint
        instead of regular paint (which is more suitable for art) would be
        appropriate in giving off a professional and sterile look.
