          <p>
            As we grow older, our hearing abilities naturally worsen and the
            spectrum of frequencies we perceive begin to narrow. Humans
            naturally flinch and try to protect their ears in reaction to loud
            and startling noises. However, extended exposure to loud but
            tolerable noises in settings or recreational activities such as
            practicing at a shooting range, riding a motorcycle, or listening to
            music at a concert can lead to hearing loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing diagnostics based on auditory input from your
            surroundings, Soundless enables people to determine whether
            surrounding noises are detrimental or not, along with getting advice
            on how to further prevent noise induced hearing loss.

      <h2>Needfinding</h2>
      <p>
        We interviewed 3 people who work in or inhabit potentially loud
        environments and observed 1 of them in an environment (specifically, a
        music recording room) that we assumed had a loud setting for 15 minutes
        each. We asked them questions to assess the type and intensity of their
        respective loud environment and observed how they reacted to it. In
        doing so, we learned that people in loud settings either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          do not know the environment they are in is potentially harmful to the
          ears or
        </li>
        <li>
          are aware the space they are in is relatively loud but tolerate or
          prefer the volume level because they get used to it after prolonged
          exposure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We then used the data to frame our problems into:</p>
      <ul class="text-secondary">
        <li>
          How can we inform users that are unaware of dangerous sound levels to
          prevent damage to their ears?
        </li>
        <li>
          How can we convince users that are aware of but tolerate dangerous
          sound levels to want to prevent damage to their ears?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Storyboards</h2>
      <p>
        Using the data we collected, we tried to address the two types of users
        and explore potential solutions by making 3 storyboards. The storyboards
        explored 3 types of solutions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          notifications when sound levels exceed recommended amount or duration
        </li>
        <li>
          receiving a daily score on your approximate sound health and steps to
          improve
        </li>
        <li>
          a hearing diagnostic to gauge current ear health by playing playing
          different frequencies
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Rapid Prototyping + Pivot</h2>
      <p>
        When making our paper prototypes, we had icons to represent the
        different features that the app could do. After having participants walk
        through some use cases, it made sense to add text to the icons since the
        icons on their own, especially when hand drawn, were not intuitive
        enough. Users mentioned that the features between the different
        prototypes could complement each other since they both promote better
        ear health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since our section's topic was 'Sound' Feedback, we also received
        feedback to try to better incorporate this into the product overall.
        Thus, we decided to produce noises during walkthroughs in order to
        facilitate sounds guiding the user when noises were harmful.

      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p>
        Next, we made wireframes to reflect the changes, compound all the
        features, and visualize the flow of the app.

      <h2>Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        We made a development plan and spent the next 3 weeks making an HTML
        prototype then a more stylized one after. Instead of mostly JSON data,
        our app used a sound recording API to receive user input through
        microphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users receive warnings after a certain amount of time to simulate what
        receiving a notification of dangerous noise levels would be like. On the
        Data page, input from a microphone is recorded and is displayed on a
        graph when the user view live updates of their current environmental
        sound levels. Another core interaction is the Diagnostic page, in which
        a user answers questions and is able to get an estimated status on his
        or her ear health. Furthermore, the Notifications page saves warnings
        received for users to reference in case they are interrupted while
        receiving a notification.
      </p>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        We picked people who went to concerts or regularly listened to music or
        audio and had them go through our app's use cases and core
        functionalities. We found that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a lack of descriptions would reduce confusion for each page's purpose
        </li>
        <li>
          JSON data messages on the Warnings page kept interrupting prototype
          testing flow
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A/B Testing + Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        For our A/B testing, we chose to add a “Recommend” button to an
        alternate version because we’ve noticed that there are some users who
        only like to engage in buttons vs. having to write comments or even
        questions. In our Design A, we included a Recommend button below the
        questions and answers submitted on the forum, to allow users to upvote
        questions and answers to stimulate engagement in the FAQ page that we
        didn't see in user testing. In our Design B, we removed the recommended
        button and just included the question and answer on the FAQ page.
      </p>
      <img src="img/soundless/googleAnalyt.png" alt="googleAnalyt" />
      <p>
        With df = 1 and p < 0.05, our statistic (1.74 < 3.84) does not make it
        to the .05 level. With a chi squared value of 1.74, we can only fail to
        reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we cannot say that the original design
        with only the “Add Question” button portion is better than the design
        with a “Recommend” button added on the FAQ page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design B was our design of choice based on our A/B testing. Design B had
        a 23.46% higher conversion rate with two more conversions than Design A.
        One explanation for Design B’s success is that the “Recommend” button is
        an easy and low cost way to engage with the page and does not require
        the user to scan multiple questions to contribute. It may also have been
        more engaging through the communal feel of interacting with another
        user's content. In comparison, Design A required users to use more
        cognitive resources and examine the questions posted in the application
        and spend time typing out a question that has not been asked yet.
