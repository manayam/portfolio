            KOTX is the first K-pop dance and social organization at UCSD. It
            was founded by Kevin Nguyen in 2015 to be a place where K-pop fans
            could share their love of Korean entertainment and learn K-pop dance
            choreography.
          </p>
          <p>
            We partnered with KOTX to make visual mockups of their
            organization's future website.

      <h2>Client Survey</h2>
      <p>
        After meeting with our clients and interviewing them about the org, we
        learned that KOTX prides itself on its all-inclusiveness and its
        approachable and fun-loving attitude. Members are passionate about K-Pop
        culture and discuss it within their Facebook group posts, but this
        sometimes occludes posts with information on upcoming events. It holds a
        mixture of social events and dance workshops that teach choreography to
        their covers. Thus, they wanted a website that communicates the vibrant
        personalities of the group along with a way to display their event
        information and covers.
      </p>

      <h2>User Interviews + Personas</h2>
      <p>
        We came up with a list of potential user types to look into and reached
        out to people based on these predicted user types. We originally
        expected to have all KOTX members be under one persona. However, after
        interviewing, we found that new members and prospective members have
        very similar needs due to their lack of familiarity with KOTX, thus it
        made sense for us to separate KOTX members into new and returning. We
        also found through our interviews that there was a group of users that
        needed information in terms of working with KOTX rather than joining the
        group.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="img/kotx/persona1.jpg" alt="persona1" style="width:100%" />
        </div>
        <div class="column">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="img/kotx/persona3.jpg" alt="persona3" style="width:50%" />
      </div>
      <p>
        For each persona, we made scenarios that they would likely encounter on
        the site and use cases for each of those scenarios. We did this to help
        us understand which features on the site that should be prioritized.

      <h2>Competitive Analysis + Moodboards</h2>
      <p>
        We looked into college organizations' websites, along with websites for
        professional dance studios or groups. We liked how the college org sites
        had a generally simple navigation and content layout but the branding
        seemed too professional and even sterile if KOTX were to employ such
        branding. Furthermore, the dance studio sites we saw were mostly black,
        which conflicted with our stakeholders' desire to have "splashes of
        color" in KOTX's shades of purple and pink from the graphics on their
        Facebook events. We realized after, however, that the choice to include
        dark colors was conscious and to emulate a dance studio or theater.
        Sites that had personalized bios of members gave a sense of familiarity
        and humor that we wanted to incorporate into our site. Thus, we took all
        this into account in our final design.

      <h2>Creative Brief + Lo-Fi Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        We then detailed our plans in a creative brief that we presented to our
        client in one of our meetings to get their feedback. In it, we detailed
        the 4 HTML pages that we planned to implement, along with our intended
        audience from our personas. We also defined our objectives for the site
        along with some sketches of what the potential design, in which the
        client agreed to after meeting.

      <h2>Hi-Fi Wireframes and Functional Specification</h2>
      <p>
        In another meeting, we detailed the features that we planned to
        implement through the annotated screenshots in our functional
        specification. The client liked the layout of the frames and we also
        performed user testing and usability issues were minor.

      <h2>Prototypes + Card Sort</h2>
      <p>
        In our latter prototypes, we decided to focus on finalizing our content
        formatting and styling. A few of our clients gave some suggestions on
        changes we could make: they wanted the format of the website to better
        emphasize gallery images, the social aspect of the group, and they
        wanted better placement of staff information.
      </p>

        <div class="column">

      <p>
        Since we wanted to determine what new navigation would work best, we
        spent a week conducting open card sorts to see how different people
        would organize and categorize the site content we are considering.
        After, we tallied the data in a spreadsheet to see which layouts seemed
        most commonly sorted. We also created 6 style tiles representing
        different branding choices and had members comment on which they liked
        in a Google Form for feedback.

      <h2>More User Testing + Final Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        While we conducted card sorting and finalizing styling, we had 3 users
        run through the site and got varying feedback on the site navigation.
        Some issues were
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          that the location of staff information was unclear because the section
          resided under ‘About’ and
        </li>
        <li>
          that ways of getting involved and joining the org weren’t very clear
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          that the gallery was hard to find because it was hidden in the archive
          of ‘Events’
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We addressed this by having the gallery (which was originally titled as
        'Archive' in the events tab) more visible and labeled as such. We also
        made a contact page since our clients wanted more emphasis on contacting
        KOTX other than the footer. Furthermore, there was a lot of overlap
        between what a dance team vs. general member could do. We clarified this
        with our client and had detailed instructions and images to illustrate
        this difference. After showing this to our client, we received positive
        feedback.
